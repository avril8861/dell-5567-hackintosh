How to force RGB in Mac OS X
These steps have been updated for Mac OS version 10.11, “El Capitan”. See below for differences for previous versions of the system.

Download the patch-edid.rb script from the forums thread above, or download Andrew Daugherity’s improved patch-edid.rb script from his github page. Put the script in your home directory.
Disable “rootless” mode, you can follow these instructions: How to modify System Integrity Protection in El Capitan.
Reboot.
Connect only the external monitor(s) in question, if you can (I closed my MacBook lid, for example). The script will make override files for any connected monitor.
Type “ruby patch-edid.rb” in Terminal.
A new folder will be created in your home directory. Move it into the “/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides” folder. You may have to create the Resources and Overrides folders. If Finder tells you that you are overwriting an existing folder, consider backing it up first.
Restart your computer. The picture quality should be fixed from this point.
Re-enable “rootless” mode, the instructions are available on the same guide: How to modify System Integrity Protection in El Capitan.
Reboot. Enjoy your monitor.
